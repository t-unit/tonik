# Test Driven Development
## Core Rules
- Always create skeleton structure of production code first
- Always write tests before implementing logic
- Only write the actual implementation after tests are written and approved by the user

## Required Workflow
1. First, create minimal skeleton code structure if needed
2. Next, write tests that verify the expected functionality
3. **CHECKPOINT**: Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding
4. Only after confirmation, implement the actual code to pass those tests

## AI Assistant Instructions
- Never skip directly to implementation without tests
- When asked to implement a feature, always respond with "Following TDD, let's write tests first"
- Explicitly ask for confirmation with: "âœ… Tests written. Shall I proceed with implementation?"
- If user requests direct implementation, remind them about TDD workflow
