# FVM Usage

## Always use FVM commands
- This project uses Flutter Version Management (FVM).
- Always prefix Flutter and Dart commands with `fvm`.

## Command Examples
- **Running tests**: `fvm dart test` (not `dart test`)
- **Running Flutter**: `fvm flutter` (not `flutter`)
- **Pub commands**: `fvm dart pub get` (not `dart pub get`)
- **Build runner**: `fvm flutter pub run build_runner build`

## Rationale
- Ensures consistent Flutter/Dart SDK version across all developers.
- Prevents version-related issues and test failures.
- The project has specific SDK version requirements that FVM manages.
