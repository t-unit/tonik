# Comments should explain "why", not "what"
- Never add comments explaining the next line or lines.
- Use comment for bigger methods to separate section dealing with different things.
- Keep comments short and precise.
- End all comments with a dot or colon.

# Documentation
- Documents all public API.
- Don't state the obvious.
- Explain parameters and argument.
- Keep documentation short


# Private and proceed methods
- Use the [meta](mdc:https:/pub.dev/packages/meta) package to annotate private and protected methods.
- Keep public interfaces as small as possible.

3. Public static properties
