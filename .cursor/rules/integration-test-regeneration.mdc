# Integration Test Regeneration

## CRITICAL: Always Use the Setup Script

**NEVER manually regenerate individual integration tests. ALWAYS use the setup script.**

When you need to regenerate integration tests after making changes to code generation logic:

### Required Command
```bash
./scripts/setup_integration_tests.sh
```

Or via melos:
```bash
melos run generate-integration-tests
```

### Why This Matters
- The setup script handles dependency overrides for local packages
- It downloads and manages the Imposter JAR for mock servers
- It runs `dart pub get` in each generated package directory
- It ensures consistent generation across all integration test suites
- It properly configures test environments

### What NOT To Do
❌ Do NOT run `dart run packages/tonik/bin/tonik.dart` manually for individual tests
❌ Do NOT try to regenerate a single integration test in isolation
❌ Do NOT skip the setup script "to save time"

### When To Use It
Run the setup script whenever:
- You change code generation logic in `packages/tonik_generate`
- You modify model structures in `packages/tonik_core`
- You update parsing logic in `packages/tonik_parse`
- You add new utilities to `packages/tonik_util` used by generated code
- You change the CLI behavior in `packages/tonik`
- The user asks to "regenerate integration tests"
- Integration tests are failing after generator changes

### After Regeneration
After running the setup script, verify the changes:
1. Check generated code in `integration_test/*/[name]_api/`
2. Run specific integration tests: `melos run test-integration-[name]`
3. Or run all tests: `melos run test`

## Default Assumption
Unless the user explicitly states otherwise, **assume you should regenerate ALL integration tests** when making generator changes. Do not ask permission—just run the script.
