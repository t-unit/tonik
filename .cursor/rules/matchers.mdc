 # Use isTrue and isFalse matchers
- Always `isTrue` and `isFalse` instead of `false` and `true.
- Never use `equals`, test against value directly.


# When working with the @code_builder package
- Use `collapseWhitespace` from the [matchers package](https://pub.dev/documentation/matcher/latest/matcher/collapseWhitespace.html), availale via importing `import 'package:test/test.dart';`
- Avoid testing single lines in generated code, make sure to test full methods
- Test as much as possible by introspecting objects of the code builder package
