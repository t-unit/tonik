# Configuration for binary_models integration test
# Tests contentMediaType mapping to Dart types

contentMediaTypes:
  # Map image/png to binary (List<int>)
  "image/png": binary
  # Map text/plain to text (String)
  "text/plain": text
  # Note: application/x-custom-unknown is NOT configured
  # to test fallback behavior (should default to binary/List<int>)
